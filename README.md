# TheMirrorIsBack
Brings back the old Gorilla Tag mirror from the dust, added Computer Interface integration (kind of)!
This is my first mod I have EVER made so don't expect much lol.

no, that is not the gorillacosmetics mirror, that one is broken rn
I'm not actually too sure what it's dependencies are tbh, I'd say use CI but it could work without it.
